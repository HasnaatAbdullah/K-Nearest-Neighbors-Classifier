# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

In this project, I implemented the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify data using Python and **Scikit-Learn**.  
The project focuses on **loading real-world datasets, fitting the model, predicting data points**, and evaluating performance.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Understand the working principle of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.
- Use **KNN** to classify different data points.
- Apply the KNN classifier on a **real-world dataset**.
- Evaluate and optimize KNN performance using different **k-values**.

## **Project Overview**

The **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm is a **supervised machine learning** technique used for **classification** and **regression** problems.  
In this project, I focused on **classification**, where the model predicts a class based on the closest data points in the feature space.

### **Key Steps**
- **Loading the Dataset**: Using real-world customer data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling, encoding, and cleaning the data.
- **Model Training**: Implementing **KNeighborsClassifier** from **Scikit-Learn**.
- **Model Prediction**: Predicting new data points using trained models.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy and testing different **k-values** to find the best performance.
